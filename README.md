# Purpose
This is a webpage built with HTML/CSS with the purpose of practicing **creation of forms; input includes email, phone, and password**.
This webpage was based off of the sign in page of mint/intuit's sign up page.

## See The Site
For now this project can be viewed from: *https://raw.githack.com/akiki-liang0/mint.com-form-webpage/master/index.html*.
The images for this site will not be available through this link due to the site not being hosted; however, in the future, this project (with all images) will be viewable from my portfolio website.
